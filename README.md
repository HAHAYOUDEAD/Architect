# Features:
- Modular base building system
- 2 building types: planks and logs (currently only differ in appearance)
- New building resources and means of gathering them
- Ghost structures to plan out buildings
- Snapping is on by default, hold `sprint key` to disable snapping
- Scaffolding for easy height access
- Precise placement with the Nudge system™. Check settings for hotkeys, available when object is snapped or in Nudge mode (`sprint key` + RMB)
- Native UI integration
- UI Localization support. **Please don't create locaizations** until full release, there will be a lot of additions and changes
### Interior detection
- Temperature is calculated based on building materials. Log building will be warmer than plank, and elevated log floors are the warmest
- Travois is allowed, while campfires only allowed on stone floors (while not implemented - there's a cheat option to enable on wooden floor)
- [More technical info](https://github.com/HAHAYOUDEAD/Architect/releases/tag/v0.7.8-beta)

# Getting started:
- Collect a few planks. They can be crafted in bundles on furniture workbench or found in the world
- Collect a bunch of nails. They can be found in the world, in containers, when breaking down certain objects with prybar, or forged
- Hold B(can be changed) to bring up building menu, place things down
- Holding `sprint key` while looking at building parts will enable additional controls
- Building and breaking down can be done with many different tools, some are better for building, some - for dismantling
### Creating interior
- Stand at the lowest floor of your building and initiate interior check from the building menu (when building mode is disabled)
- Message with check result will be shown, if it failed and you're not sure why - enable debug mode in settings to see the check visualized and detailed results in console
